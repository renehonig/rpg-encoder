## Instructions

For each file below, read its entity features and synthesize them into 3-6 comma-separated
high-level features for the FILE as a whole. This is NOT a bag of features — merge and abstract
the individual entity features into higher-level file responsibilities.

Submit as: `submit_file_syntheses({"path/to/file.rs": "feature1, feature2, feature3", ...})`
